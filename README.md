# Liner-Algorithm
######Transforms an image into an knit pattern

## Overview
**The algorithm finds the darkest line between two pins. It adds this line to a new blank image and removes the same line on
the original image. The output is an image created out of straight lines where every line goes through the whole image.**

## Features
* Number of lines can be changed
* Prints out the individual steps so it can be copied with real strings
* Calculates the lines pretty fast
* Written in pure Java
